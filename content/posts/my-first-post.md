## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
In the digital age, having a personal website is more than a luxuryâ€”it's a necessity for professionals, students, and hobbyists alike. Whether you're showcasing your portfolio, publishing your blog, or presenting your project, the combination of Hugo and GitHub Pages offers a powerful, easy-to-use platform that stands out for its speed and flexibility.

### Engagement
Imagine being able to deploy updates to your website with a simple push to a repository, or building your entire site in less than a second. That's the reality for users of Hugo and GitHub Pages. As a developer who has juggled multiple projects, I've found this approach to not only save time but also to significantly enhance the visibility of my work online.

## 2. What are GitHub Pages and Hugo?

### GitHub Pages:
GitHub Pages is a complimentary hosting service that provides the simplicity and reliability needed for personal and project websites. Its seamless GitHub integration allows for easy updates, supports custom domains, offers SSL encryption for secure connections, and is perfectly suited for static site generators like Jekyll, and by extension, Hugo.

### Hugo:
Hugo is an open-source static site generator that is celebrated for its blazing-fast performance and ease of use. It excels in generating pages in milliseconds, supports a wide range of content types, and leverages Markdown for content creation, offering a straightforward yet flexible way to build websites.

## 3. Prerequisites

- Tools and Accounts Required:
  - A GitHub account
  - Git installed on your computer
  - Hugo installed on your system

## 4. Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Creating a GitHub Repository:
   Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. This will serve as the home for your website's code and content.

### 2. Installing Hugo:

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install hugo
```

#### Windows:
```bash
choco install hugo -confirm
```

### 3. Creating a New Hugo Site:
```bash
hugo new site [your-site-name] --format yaml #replace [your-site-name] with your site name
```
After creating your site, navigate into your site's directory:
```bash
cd [your-site-name]
```

### 4. Adding a Theme:
Select a theme from the Hugo themes directory. To add the PaperMod theme, for example:
```bash
git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
And in `hugo.yaml`, include:
```yaml
theme: ["PaperMod"]
```

### 5. Adding the Post:
Create your first post with:
```bash
hugo new content/posts/[my-first-post.md] #replace my-first-post.md with your post name
```
Edit the post to add content, remember to set the draft status to false to publish.

### 6. Publishing the Site:
Build your site with Hugo by running:
```bash
hugo
```

### 6. Deploying to GitHub Pages:
Follow these steps to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, including the creation of a deployment script for automation.
